It also provides [documentation about the models themselves](./MODELS.md).

## Installing and using the LSFM 3D Morphable Model construction pipeline

The code used to produce the LSFM models is **contained within this repository** and is completely open source under a **BSD license**. You are free to follow the [code's documentation](./CODE.md), which explains how to install this tool and run it yourself on a set of facial meshes to automatically build a 3D Morphable Model.

## Acquiring the LSFM Models

The **LSFM models** were produced by using this software pipeline on the (proprietary) MeIn3D dataset. For full terms and conditions, and to request access to the models, please visit the [LSFM website](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/lsfm/). For technical details on the models we provide, see [MODELS.md](./MODELS.md).
